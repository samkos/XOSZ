** installation of Zephyr on XtreemOS
**    Samuel KORTAS (January 2010)


1) compiling and running Zephyr in sequential mode:

a) installation of prerequisite

in order to compile Zephyr you need to have installed the following
packages :

urpmi gfortran -a
urpmi SOFTS/gnuplot-*

b) compilation

then you can compile Zephyr

cd SRC
make

... to obtain the executable SRC/zephyr

c) run a test

from SRC directory, type :

./zephyr ../ADAT/zephyrcr2.dat

Zephyr should starts the calculation, dumping global convergence results on standard output.

d) other examples,   backup/restore example

the ../ADAT contains other examples of input files. 

among them, 
      zephyr28_save.dat
that calculate a test solution from t=0 to t=0.2,  dumping current results in a file

and 
    zephyr28_retrieve.dat
that restore former calculation and continues it.




the result output should appear on the screen and be
saved along with the input file used in the directory
cr2/<nb_procs>/<date_of_test>


2) compiling and running Zephyr in mpi mode

a) install additional required packages

urpmi gcc-c++
y
urpmi rsh
export F77=g77

cd SOFTS
tar xvfz lam-6.5.9.tar.gz 
cd lam-6.5.9
./configure --with-fc=gfortran --prefix=/home/samy/local
make -j 4
make install


b) compile Zephyr for lam

cd ../../SRC
make -f Makefile.mpi clean
make -f Makefile.mpi



... to obtain the executable SRC/zephyr

c) run a test

cd RUN


adduser sk
cd
chown -R sk.sk XOSZ
mv XOSZ ~sk/
su  - sk
cd /home/sk/XOSZ/RUN

echo `hostname` 16 >  ~/HOSTS

. ./runXosMPI cr2 4
.... meaning run zephyr on 1 node only
     using the dataset ../ADAT/zephyrcr.dat as input 

the result output should appear on the screen and be
saved along with the input file used in the directory
cr2/<nb_procs>/<date_of_test>
