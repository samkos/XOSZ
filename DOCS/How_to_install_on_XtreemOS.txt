** installation of Zephyr on XtreemOS
**    Samuel KORTAS (January 2010)


1) compiling and running Zephyr in sequential mode:

a) installation of prerequisite

in order to compile Zephyr you need to have installed the following
packages :

urpmi gfortran -a
urpmi SOFTS/gnuplot-*

b) compilation

then you can compile Zephyr

cd SRC
make

... to obtain the executable SRC/zephyr

c) run a test

cd RUN

./runXOS cr2 1
.... meaning run zephyr on 1 node only
     using the dataset ../ADAT/zephyrcr.dat as input 

the result output should appear on the screen and be
saved along with the input file used in the directory
cr2/<nb_procs>/<date_of_test>


2) compiling and running Zephyr in mpi mode

urpmi gcc-c++
urpmi rsh
export F77=g77

cd SOFTS
tar xvfz lam-6.5.9.tar.gz 
cd lam-6.5.9
./configure --with-fc=gfortran
make -j 4
make install

cd ../../SRC
